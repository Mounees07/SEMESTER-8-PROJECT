Fix Summary:
- File: frontend/src/pages/teacher/TeacherQuestionManager.jsx, frontend/src/pages/teacher/TeacherQuestionManager.css
- Issue: User requested a "unique design layout" for the Question Manager.
- Fix: Created a custom CSS file implementing a full-screen "Command Center" layout with dark mode, glassmorphism, and neon accents. Refactored the JSX to use this new structure (Sidebar + Canvas) instead of the generic dashboard grid.
