Fix Summary:
- File: frontend/src/pages/teacher/TeacherCourseCatalog.jsx
- Issue: Page title "Available Courses" differed from Sidebar label "My Courses".
- Fix:
  1. Updated H1 title to "My Courses".

- Context: Combined with previous Sidebar renaming, this ensures "My Courses" is the single, consistent term used across the entire application for this feature, regardless of user role.
